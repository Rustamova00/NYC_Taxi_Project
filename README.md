**Project Title:** Optimizing TLC Driver Earnings and Customer Demand 
Background: TLC Drivers in NYC can work on Lyft and Uber offering rideshare to NYC Residents and tourists. TLC drivers are often working as a side hustle and even full time to gain income, to optimize their earnings and time spend on this job, I wanted to create a solution to optimize their work schedules. 

**Objective:**
•	Identify good performing regions and times for driver earnings.
•	Recommend optimal locations and work schedule strategies to boost earnings during low-demand hours.
•	Improve the alignment between driver availability and peak customer demand.

**Data:** The Data set is open sourced from the TLC website. It’s a dataset containing historical trip data, including trip distance, duration, fare amount, tips, pickup and drop-off locations, and timestamps, was analyzed to identify patterns and optimization opportunities.
